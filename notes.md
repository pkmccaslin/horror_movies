From u/Geek-Haven888:

This October is now the 6th year of my project recording the settings of horror movies.
This project is a study of where horror movies are set, partly out of curiosity, and partly because I’m the type of person who likes making lists and graphs for fun. The object of the study was to see what states and countries horror movies are mostly set in, even if the movie in question was not shot in that location. Link to chart here
Methodology and Criteria
In total 6342 (+3151 from last year) individual movies, shorts, and miniseries were included in the study, although some movies are counted more than once if they took place in several states or countries. 3280 (+1559) of the films took place in the United States, 2510 (+1316) took place Internationally, 83 (+41) took place in “Other” locations (Space, Alternate Worlds/Dimensions, Fictional Countries/States, Heaven/Hell), and 662 (+358) took place in an unknown location.
In cases where the setting of the film is not outright stated, I used context clues such as license plates, driver's licenses, newspapers, references to cities, and so on. While I did take into account where the movie was filmed, I tried not to use that as definitive evidence (there is a reason why the tropes California Doubling and the Mountains of Illinois exist).
Amongst movies included in the Unknown category, the majority of them are intended to take place in the United States but are left vague as to their exact locations.
US Horror
In total 3280 (+1559) movies took place in the United States. The top 5 states were as follows
California - 1044 (+543)
New York - 405 (+205)
Texas - 135 (+48)
Florida - 117 (+57)
Pennsylvania - 103 (+53)
In regards to federal districts and territories, we have Washington DC with 11 (+5), Puerto Rico at 6 (+3); Northern Marianas Islands and the US Virgin Islands with 1 each.
International Horror
In total 2510 (+1316) movies took place outside the United States. The top 5 nations were as follows
United Kingdom - 485 (+226); England - 408 (+191), Scotland 40 (+14), Wales 25 (+15), Northern Ireland 6 (+3), Channel Islands 2, Bermuda 1, British Virgin Island 1 (+1), Gibraltar - 1 (+1), and Isle of Man - 1 (+1)
Canada - 282 (+132)
Japan - 167 (+121)
Italy - 146 (+98)
France - 129 (+77); Métropole 127 (+75), French Guiana - 1 (+1), and Martinique - 1 (+1)
When divided by continents and geographic regions the results are as follows:
Europe - 1351 (+725)
North America (minus the USA) - 423 (+190)
Asia - 399 (+242)
Oceania - 130 (+48)
South America - 90 (+57)
Africa - 64 (+33)
Oceans - 41 (+17)
Arctic Circle - 6 (+1)
Antarctica - 6 (+2)
I hope you all find this as interesting as I do. If anyone notices any mistakes or can help with the Location Unknown movies, please comment. Please also give recommendations for movies, particularly if they take place in a location not on the chart. Also in the comments below, I'll put a list of locations with the highest rating (according to IMDB). Films in bold are the new highest-rated movies in that state/country since last year. I have also gotten into using Letterbox in the last year, and have started creating lists of the individual locations. You can see all the lists here
